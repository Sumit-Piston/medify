## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 2: Technical Complexity (Charts)
**Mitigation:**
- Use proven package (`fl_chart`)
- Start with simple charts, add complexity later
- Have fallback: show metrics without charts if needed

### Risk 3: App Store Rejection
**Mitigation:**
- Follow all Play Store guidelines
- Clear, honest Privacy Policy
- Professional assets
- Thorough testing
- No placeholder content
