# ⚡ Quick Fix Summary - Release Build Crash

## 🎯 Issue
Release APK crashed immediately: **"The resource ic_notification could not be found"**

## ✅ Fix Applied
Changed notification icon from vector XML to PNG:
- **Before:** `'ic_notification'` (❌ XML vector - fails in release)
- **After:** `'@mipmap/ic_launcher'` (✅ PNG mipmap - works everywhere)

## 📍 Changed In
`lib/core/services/notification_service.dart` - 4 locations updated

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. **Build is running** (release APK generation in progress)
2. **After build completes**, install with:
   ```bash
   adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
   ```
3. **Test** that app launches and notifications work

## 📦 Installation Options

### Option 1: ADB (if you have Android SDK)
```bash
# Install ADB
brew install --cask android-platform-tools

# Connect phone via USB (enable USB Debugging)
adb devices

# Install APK
adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

### Option 2: Direct File Transfer
1. Copy `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk` to Google Drive
2. Download on phone
3. Tap to install

### Option 3: Flutter Run (if device connected)
```bash
fvm flutter run --release
```
