## 🎓 Key Learnings & Best Practices

1. **Shimmer > Spinners**: Skeleton screens provide better perceived performance
2. **Color Coding**: Visual cues (green/yellow/red) improve data comprehension
3. **Filter UX**: Clear visual feedback with chips and easy reset options
4. **Calendar Integration**: `table_calendar` is powerful but needs custom builders for markers
5. **CSV Export**: Temporary file handling with proper cleanup is essential
6. **State Management**: BLoC pattern scales well for complex features
7. **Chart Libraries**: `fl_chart` provides great flexibility but requires careful configuration
