## üöÄ Phase 1: Pre-Submission Setup (30-60 minutes)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Update Android Configuration

#### 1.1 Update Package Name & Version

Open `android/app/build.gradle` and update:

```gradle
android {
    namespace "com.sumit.medify"  // Update this
    compileSdk 34                // Update from 33 to 34

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.sumit.medify"  // Update this

        targetSdkVersion 34  // Update from 33 to 34
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0.0"
    }
}
```

#### 1.2 Update Root build.gradle (Android SDK)

buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.9.0'  // or latest stable
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:8.1.0'  // or latest
    }
}
```

**Current Status:** ‚è≥ Needs verification

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Generate App Signing Key

**CRITICAL:** This keystore is needed to sign your app. Never lose it!

#### 2.1 Generate Keystore

Run this command in terminal:

```bash
keytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/medify-upload-keystore.jks \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000 -alias medify-upload
```

**You'll be asked:**

- Password: Choose a STRONG password (save it securely!)
- Name: Your name
- Organization: Medify or your organization
- Location: Your city
- State: Your state
- Country Code: Your 2-letter country code (e.g., IN for India, US for USA)

**Save these securely:**

- Keystore password: **\*\***\_\_\_**\*\***
- Key alias: `medify-upload`
- Keystore location: `~/medify-upload-keystore.jks`

#### 2.2 Create key.properties File

Create file: `android/key.properties`

```properties
storePassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyPassword=YOUR_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD
keyAlias=medify-upload
storeFile=/Users/sumitpal/medify-upload-keystore.jks
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Add this to `.gitignore` - never commit passwords!

#### 2.3 Update android/app/build.gradle for Signing

Add this BEFORE `android {`:

```gradle
def keystoreProperties = new Properties()
def keystorePropertiesFile = rootProject.file('key.properties')
if (keystorePropertiesFile.exists()) {
    keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))
}

android {
    // ... existing config ...

    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']
            keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']
            storeFile keystoreProperties['storeFile'] ? file(keystoreProperties['storeFile']) : null
            storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']
        }
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            signingConfig signingConfigs.release
            // ... other release config ...
        }
    }
}
```
